-ASK the CSA's for help. They will do their best if only you ASK
-Turn off the WiFi when you test
-Double check to make sure you have the Ethernet dongles

Things to do next time
----------------------
-Get [2] Ethnet dongles for the team
-download all of the updated software on to the computers before the competion

-Tune lift PID
-Tune Hatch Arm: go up/down
-Make limelight a basic camera

[Day 1]
Everything didnt work. We were missing the updates for various eletrical and software components.
 we also had connectivity issues with the robot and the FMS. During the match, the robot would give short burst of 
 drive before disconnecting again. All of these issues were resolved by the end of the day after the CSA's downloaded 
 all the new software.

[Day 2]
Everything works. We still need to apply the limelight. Will go over what needs to
get done at a later date.
